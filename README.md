automatic_pool_filler
=====================

This project contains the source code and design files for my automatic pool filler project.  This project implements a device to keep a swimming pool water level between a set pair of levels.  The system consists of a level sensor, an MSP430 microcontroller with associated electronics, and a hose value with latching solenoid.  The system is battery powered.  It has an interlock to disable it when operation is not desired, usch as during rainy periods or when the pool is in use.  See the design documents for a detailed overview.
